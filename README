Building
--------

Jekyll uses GNU Make for building. It has a separate Makefile for the
Microsoft Windows platform and for GNU/Linux. The following components
are required to build/compile Jekyll:

* GNU Make
* gcc or MinGW (on Microsoft Windows)
* gccmakedep
* GLib/GTK+ 2 development files and shared libraries (including all
  dependencies like GObject, Pango, GDK, ...)
* OpenSSL development files and shared libraries

You need also your own OAuth consumer key and secret. Having a key
and secret please update the related settings in the Makefile.build
file ("TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY" and "TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET").

If all required components are installed properly on your machine you
can build Jekyll using the GNU Make utility:

# make -f Makefile.{platform} depend
# make -f Makefile.{platform}

To build Jekyll on Microsoft Windows please ensure that all
directories in the related Makefile are correct.

By default Jekyll will be installed in /usr/local. To change the
location you can set the PREFIX variable:

# make -f Makefile.linux PREFIX=/foo/bar


Installation
------------

If Jekyll has been build successfully you can install it by typing in:

# make -f Makefile.linux install PREFIX=/foo/bar


Code documentation
------------------

To create the code documentation please ensure that doxygen is 
installed on your system and type in:

# make -f Makefile.{platform} documentation
